//You have to fill up your gas and there are multiple gas stations with different prices
// and different distance to you. Sometimes it is cheaper to drive to a more distant gas station, 
//because the prices are cheaper!

// Your tank can contain 60l at maximum.
// You always fill your tank full
// Calculate the current fuel in tank with the actual price of the gas stations
// Your task:
// Given an object with multiple gas stations, your currentFuel as integer between 0 and 60 and the fuel consumption of your car (l/100km, float) - find the cheapest gas station and return the name of the gas station!

// Return undefined (in JS) | None (in Python) if there are no gas station or your fuel is not enough to reach one!

// No need to test for invalid input!
// Remember: You also need fuel to drive to the gas station! The way back home should also be considered :)
